## Overview
This notebook uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Naive Bayes classification to analyze a wine dataset. The goal is to visualize and classify wines based on their chemical properties.

## Process
1-Data Loading: Loads a wine dataset with various chemical properties.
2-Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data by checking for missing values and converting data types as needed.
3-PCA for Dimensionality Reduction: Reduces the dataset to two principal components to visualize data in 2D.
4-Classification with Naive Bayes: Trains a Naive Bayes classifier and evaluates it using a test set.
5-Results: Displays a 2D scatter plot and provides classification metrics (classification report and confusion matrix).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hrdkcodes/wine-data)).

Please download the dataset and follow the instructions to place it in the correct folder.
